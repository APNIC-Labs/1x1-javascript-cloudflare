This CloudFlare app adds a simple measurement system to your webpage.
It uses undisplayed 1x1.png pixel image fetches to test aspects of
DNS, transport and other capabilities from the client to the Internet.

The results of the measurement are made publicly available at http://labs.apnic.net.

Website owners who include this app contribute significantly to our
understanding of strategic Internet deployment issues. 

The pixel fetches are limited by a default cookie of 30 days to prevent over-sampling.

APNIC does not reveal the browsing of any individual user and only
publishes aggregate data at the Network/Economy/Region/World level.
